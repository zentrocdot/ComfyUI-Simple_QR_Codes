## Introduction

So far I have created three nodes. The first, the simplest, was for
testing and learning purposes. The main goal is to create good looking
QR codes that can be used in ComfyUI ComfyUI or that can be saved and
used in other applications or in other contexts.

The second node can create colorful QR codes and round corners can be
added. The third node can be used to integrate logos or image in the QR 
code.

One idea I have since discarded is the ability to invert the created images.
Especially with the QR code with logo, this idea no longer makes sense.

# Special Features

A special feature of the second node is the ability to add round corners to the QR code.

## To-Do

In the course of the day I will programme a qr code scan node. Then I 
can check the result of the QR code creation within the same workflow.
