## Introduction

So far I have created three nodes. The first, the simplest, was for
testing and learning purposes. The main goal is to create good looking
QR codes that can be used in ComfyUI ComfyUI or that can be saved and
used in other applications or in other contexts.

## To-Do

In the course of the day I will programme a qr code scan node. Then I 
can check the result of the QR code creation within the same workflow.
