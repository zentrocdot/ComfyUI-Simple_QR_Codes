## Preface

A distinction must be made between the terms node and node. In the
Comfy registry there is a node registered. In this case this is the
<code>ComfyUI-Simple_QR_Codes</code> node. Such a node can be installed
using the ComfyUI Manager or using a terminal window and cloning the
node to the correct directory. In case of my registered node, there are
five different nodes are contained which can be used in a workflow

## Introduction

<p align="justify">So far I have created three nodes. The first, the 
simplest, was for testing and learning purposes. The main goal is to 
create good looking QR codes that can be used in ComfyUI ComfyUI or
that can be saved and used in other applications or in other contexts.</p>

<p align="justify">The second node can create colorful QR codes and
round corners can be added. The third node can be used to integrate
logos or image in the QR code.</p> 

<p align="justify">One idea I have since discarded is the ability to 
invert the created images. Especially with the QR code with logo, this
idea no longer makes sense.</p>

The node is supplied with everything needed to work with each node.

# Special Features

A special feature of the second node is the ability to add round corners to the QR code.

## Open Issues

<p align="justify">Using the Python package <code>qrcode</code> it
is not clear how to control the size of the created QR code. For the
moment the QR Code is created an then this QR code is resized. This
leads to a loss in quality.</p>

## To-Do

<p align="justify">In the course of the day I will programme a qr code
scan node. Then I can check the result of the QR code creation within
the same workflow.</p>
