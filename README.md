# ComfyUI Simple QR Codes Node

## Preface

<p align="justify">A distinction must be made between the terms node
and node. In the Comfy registry there is a node registered. In this 
case this is the <code>ComfyUI-Simple_QR_Codes</code> node. Such a
node can be installed using the ComfyUI Manager or using a terminal
window and cloning the node to the correct directory. In case of my
registered node, there are five different nodes are contained which
can be used in a workflow.</p>

## Get Started

<p align="justify">For the QR code generation one can use the Python
module <code>qrcode</code> or the Python module <code>segno</code>. I
make use of both of them. However, I now prefer the use of the Python 
module segno for generating QR codes. The focus for further development
is on this segno based node</p>

# Qrcode Based 

## Introduction

<p align="justify">So far I have created three nodes. The main goal
is to create good looking QR codes that can be used in ComfyUI ComfyUI
or that can be saved and used in other applications or in other 
contexts.</p>

<p align="justify">The first node, the simplest, was for testing and
learning purposes. The second node can create colorful QR codes and
round corners can be added. The third node can be used to integrate
logos or image in the QR code.</p> 

<p align="justify">One idea I have since discarded is the ability to 
invert the created images. Especially with the QR code with logo, this
idea no longer makes sense.</p>

<p align="justify">The node is supplied with everything needed to work
with each node.</p>

## Nodes Preview

<p align="justify">Figure 2 shows a preview of the three nodes which
can be used for the creation of QR codes. In the text area one writes
the text which should be encoded as QR code.</p>

## Special Features

<p align="justify">A special feature of the second node is the
ability to add round corners to the QR code.</p>

## Limitations

<p align="justify">The rudimentary QR code reader node is only
suitable for reading black QR code on white background so far.</p>

## Open Issues

<p align="justify">Using the Python package <code>qrcode</code> it
is not clear how to control the size of the created QR code. For the
moment the QR Code is created an then this QR code is resized. This
leads to a loss in quality.</p>

## To-Do

<p align="justify">In the course of the day I will programme a qr code
scan node. Then I can check the result of the QR code creation within
the same workflow.</p>
